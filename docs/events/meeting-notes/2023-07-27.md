## Discussions:

Sherif, asked about the openQA status

Stack, they are working on that and still improving it

Sherif, asked about the PMIX support and how to do it

Jeremy, it is a bit more complex than what it seems but worth doing

David, what is the added value from moving the PMIX to newer version

Jeremy, we need to look at the user base and see if this is needed

Stack, asks about PMIX and what it is

David, the extension for pmix is more needed when you implement on scale and performance is an issue within slurm

Greg, we can have pmix into the SIG, that's not a bad idea

Jeremy, we will also need runtime aspects of it

David, yes we will need both
